Where were you
When I was burned and broken?
While the days slipped by
From my window watching

And where were you
When I was hurt and I was helpless?
'Cause the things you say
And the things you do surround me

While you were hanging yourself
On someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining Sun

Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life
And the seeds of change were planted
Outside, the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous
But irresistible pastime

I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life

I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight into the shining Sun
